# Hey, I'm Ayush Kumar Malik

**AI/ML Engineer** building intelligent systems with LLMs, RAG, and production ML.

MS in Computer Science @ Indiana University Bloomington

## What I'm Working On

- Building RAG systems and multi-agent architectures
- Contributing to open source ML infrastructure
- Fine-tuning LLMs for specialized tasks

## Featured Projects

### [CodePilot](https://github.com/ayushm98/Devon)
Multi-agent AI system for autonomous software development. Uses coordinated LLM agents for code generation, testing, and debugging.

### [VerbaQuery](https://github.com/ayushm98/VerbaQuery)
Production RAG system for document Q&A. Implements hybrid search with semantic + keyword retrieval and multi-query expansion.

### [LLM Tool Specialist](https://github.com/ayushm98/llama-tool-specialist)
Fine-tuned Llama model for tool calling and function execution. Evaluated on custom benchmarks for structured output accuracy.

## Tech Stack

**ML/AI:** PyTorch, Transformers, LangChain, vLLM, RAG
**Infrastructure:** Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, GCP
**Languages:** Python, TypeScript, SQL

## Open Source Contributions

Contributing to HuggingFace Transformers, PyTorch Lightning, and Chroma.
