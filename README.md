# Hey, I'm Ayush Kumar Malik

**AI/ML Engineer** building intelligent systems with LLMs, RAG, and production ML.

MS in Computer Science @ Indiana University Bloomington | GPA: 3.9/4.0

## What I'm Working On

- Building real-time AI systems and multi-agent architectures
- Deploying production RAG pipelines with hybrid search
- Developing MLOps infrastructure for model monitoring and A/B testing

## Featured Projects

### [CodePilot](https://github.com/ayushm98/devon) | [Live Demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ayushm98/codepilot)
Multi-agent AI system for autonomous code generation. Four specialized agents (Planner, Coder, Reviewer, Explorer) orchestrate complex coding tasks with sandboxed execution using E2B.

**Tech:** Claude Sonnet 4.5, LangGraph, E2B Sandbox, Hybrid Search (BM25 + Semantic)

### [ML-Monitor](https://github.com/ayushm98/ml-monitor) | [Live Demo](http://136.116.111.145:3000)
Production MLOps platform for real-time fraud detection achieving sub-100ms inference latency. Includes automated model retraining with drift detection and comprehensive Grafana monitoring.

**Tech:** FastAPI, XGBoost, MLflow, Prometheus, Grafana, Docker

### [Cascade](https://github.com/ayushm98/cascade) | [Live Demo](http://136.111.230.240:8501)
Intelligent LLM router with semantic caching achieving 60% cost reduction. Routes queries to optimal models (GPT-4/GPT-3.5) based on complexity classification with 97% accuracy.

**Tech:** DistilBERT, Qdrant (Vector DB), Redis, Streamlit

## Tech Stack

**ML/AI:** PyTorch, HuggingFace Transformers, LangChain, Sentence-Transformers
**LLM & RAG:** GPT-4 API, Claude API, Function Calling, Hybrid Search, Cross-Encoder Reranking
**Vector Databases:** ChromaDB, FAISS, Qdrant
**Infrastructure:** AWS (EC2, S3), Docker, FastAPI, PostgreSQL
**Languages:** Python, SQL
